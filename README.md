# Text_Mining
This repository showcases some of the text mining projects I developed over the course of the semester. These projects highlight my skills in natural language processing (NLP), data preprocessing, and machine learning techniques applied to text data. Each project demonstrates my ability to solve complex problems and extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data.
